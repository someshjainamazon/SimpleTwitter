Twitter looking app 

I have implemented the following functionalities : 

1. User can sign in using OAuth. 
2. User can view tweets from home timeline along with profile picture, relative timestamp.
3. Bitly links are clickable. 
4. User can compose a new tweet and it will be visible on the home timeline after posting. 
5. Infinite Scroll.
6. Swipe Refresh.
7. User can see counter of the number of characters left.
8. Persistence added using active android.
